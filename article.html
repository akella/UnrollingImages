<p>Do you like unrolling things? Or may be you prefer rolling them in?</p>
<p>I spent my childhood doing crepes. I loved those rolles.</p>

	<img src="assets/roll.jpg" alt="rolled crepes">
</figure>
<p>I guess, the time has come to unroll all the things. And to unroll as many rolls as possible i decided to automate this process with a bit of JS and WebGL. </p>

<h2>Set Up</h2>
<p>I will be using THREE.js for this animation, and set up a basic scene with some planes.<br>
Just as in <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/12/16/scroll-refraction-and-shader-effects-in-three-js-and-react/">this tutorial</a> by Paul Henschel we will replace all the images with those PlaneGeometry objects. So with this html in mind:</p>
<pre class="brush:html">
&lt;img src=&ldquo;owl.jpg&rdquo; class=&ldquo;js-image&gt;
</pre>
Once the page loads i will hide them:
<pre class="brush:css">
.js-image{opacity:0}
</pre>
<p>Then i will get dimensions and sizes of each image and position my 3D Planes exactly in place of each DOM image element.</p>
<pre class="brush:js">
MY_SCENE.add(
	new THREE.Mesh(
		new PlaneGeometry(640,480),  // some size of image
		new Material({texture:’owl.jpg’) // texture i took from DOM
	)
)
</pre>
<p>Because rolling things with CSS or SVG is next to impossible, i needed all the power of WebGL, and i moved parts of my page into that world. But i like the idea of progressive enhancement, so we still have the usual images there in code, and if 3d is not working, user would just see them.</p>

<p>After that, its quite easy to sync the scroll of the page with my 3D scene position. For that i used custom  smooth scroll described in <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/07/10/how-to-add-smooth-scrolling-with-inner-image-animations-to-a-web-page/">amazing tutorial</a> by Mary Lou.  You should definitely check it out, as it works regardless of platform and actions that you use to scroll. You know this is usually the biggest pain with custom scrolling libraries.</p>

<h1>Roll</h1>
<p>So, we have it in 3D! Now with power of shaders we can do anything!<br>
Well, anything <em>we</em> are capable of, at least =).</p>
<figure>
	<video src="assets/wireframe.mp4" muted autoplay loop width="600"></video>
	<figcaption>
		Red parts are WebGL, everything else HTML.
	</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I started from the end. I imagine every animation i do, as some function which takes number between 0 and 1 (i call it `progress`), and returns visual. So result of my imaginary RollFunction(0), should be something rolled. And RollFunction(1), should be just the default position of the plane.
That’s how i got the last line of my animation:</p>
<pre class="brush:glsl">
vec3 finalPosition = mix(RolledPosition, DefaultPosition,progress);
</pre>
<p>I had DefaultPosition from the start, its usually called `position` (surprise). So all i needed, to create this RolledPosition, and change my progress!</p>

<p>I figured a couple of ways to do that. I could have had another object(like an .obj file) done in some editor, or even fully exported animation from Blender or other program. <br>
But i decided to transform DefaultPosition into RolledPosition with a couple of math functions inside my Vertex shader. So, imagine we have a plane lying in Z plane, so,  to roll something like that, you could do this:<p>

<pre class="brush:glsl">
RolledPosition.x = RADIUS*cos(position.x);
RolledPosition.y = position.y; // stays the same
RolledPosition.z = RADIUS*sin(position.x);
</pre>

<p>If you ever tried to draw circle yourself, you can easily guess where its coming from.  If not here is a famous GIF illustrating how it's all related:</p>
<figure>
	<img src="assets/sine.gif" alt="sine + cosine = circle">
	<figcaption>
		See how those two functions are essentially part of circle.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of course this would just make a (not so) perfect tube out of our plane, but just adding a couple of parameters here, can make it a real roll:</p>

<pre class="brush:glsl">
RADIUS *= 1 - position.x; // so it gets smaller when we roll plane
newposition.z =  RADIUS*sin(position.x*TWO_PI);
newposition.x =  RADIUS*cos(position.x*TWO_PI); 
</pre>

<p>And you will get something like that:</p>
<figure>

  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/claimred/pen/JNZPPJ'>Archimedean spiral unroll animation</a> by Ted

	</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This two-dimensional animation has really helped me to get the idea of rolling things. So i recommend you to dig into the code, its quite interesting!</p>

<p>After that step, it was a matter of time and arithmetics to play a bit with progress, so i have this kind of animation for my plane:</p>
<video src="assets/final.mp4" muted loop autoplay></video>
<p>There are a number of other steps, to make angle parametric, and to make it a bit more beautiful with subtle shadows, but thats the most important part right here. Sine and Cosine functions are often at the core of all the cool things you see on the web! =).</p>

<p>So let me know, do you like these rolls, and how much time have you spent scrolling it back and forth just to see ‘em roll! Have a nice day! =)</p>
